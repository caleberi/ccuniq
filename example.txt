EXAMPLES
     Assuming a file named cities.txt with the following content:

           Madrid
           Lisbon
           Madrid

     The following command reports three different lines since identical elements are not adjacent:

           $ uniq -u cities.txt
           Madrid
           Lisbon
           Madrid

     Sort the file and count the number of identical lines:

           $ sort cities.txt | uniq -c
                   1 Lisbon
                   2 Madrid

     Assuming the following content for the file cities.txt:

           madrid
           Madrid
           Lisbon

     Show repeated lines ignoring case sensitiveness:

           $ uniq -d -i cities.txt
           madrid

     Same as above but showing the whole group of repeated lines:

           $ uniq -D -i cities.txt
           madrid
           Madrid

     Report the number of identical lines ignoring the first character of every line:

           $ uniq -s 1 -c cities.txt
                   2 madrid
                   1 Lisbon
